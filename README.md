# Pneumonia_Classifying-X-Ray-Images_computervision
Classifying X-Ray Images One of the core tasks in computer vision is image classification, which is the process of assigning a category to images from a fixed set of labels. Applied image classification to a dataset of chest X-ray images to determine whether patients have pneumonia.



Download the Chest X-Ray Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/beginner-chest-xray-image-classification).


Note:	The chest X-ray datasets each contain two folders. The Normal folders contain x-rays of healthy people, while the Pneumonia folders contain images of patients with pneumonia.
Since this is a large Dataset containing images ,I have deleted lots of images around 2500 images in both test and train(Multiple times crashed)
I tried my level best to sort it .I hope you will consider my work and the prediction are really good. I have taken 79% data for training the model and remaining data for testing...I have uploaded the best fit model too.
